The purpose of this lab is to familiarize the Student with Per Request Policies.  
The F5 Access Policy Manager (APM) provides two types of policies.

Access Policy - The access policy runs when a client initiates a session.   Depending
on the actions you include in the access policy, it can authenticate the user
and perform group or class queries to populate session variables with data for
use throughout the session.

Per-Request Policy - After a session starts, a per-request policy runs each time
the client makes an HTTP or HTTPS request.   A per-request policy can include a
subroutine, which starts a subsession.  Multiple subsessions can exist at one
time.   One access policy and one per-request are specified within a virtual server.









Objective:

-  Gain an understanding of Per Request policies

-  Gain an understanding of Step-up Authentication

-  Gain an understanding of Group Control

An APM Per-request policy runs when a client initiates a session.  Depending
on the actions included in the access policy, it can authenticate a user
and perform group or class queries to populate session variables with data
for use throughout a session.
